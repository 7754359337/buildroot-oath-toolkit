	  The OATH Toolkit provide components for building one-time
	  password authentication systems. It contains shared
	  libraries, command line tools and a PAM module. Supported
	  technologies include the event-based HOTP
	  algorithm (RFC4226) and the time-based TOTP
	  algorithm (RFC6238). OATH stands for Open AuTHentication,
	  which is the organization that specify the algorithms.
	  For managing secret key files, the Portable Symmetric
	  Key Container (PSKC) format described in RFC6030
	  is supported.
